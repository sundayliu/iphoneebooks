# Things that would be nice to implement #
As of 8/31/2007
  * Some sort of page numbering system, even if it's just calculated by number of screens, and a "jump to page" button.  This may be as close as we can get to a "jump to percentage" functionality.  (thanks samsonu.mobile)  -- **Superceded by scroll-slider.**

  * Is there a footnote standard for HTML?  Being able to tap a footnote and read it right there would be great.  I have no idea how to implement this at the moment...

  * Allow deletion of books directly from the file browser. **Done a while ago.**
  * Bookmarking?  Press a button to set a bookmark at the top of the page, click the bookmark to remove it.  Is this neccesary if persistence works?  Some sort of "Go to bookmark" functionality would also be needed as well, then.
  * Better filenames for chapters, via GutenSplit.

# Things that will never be implemented #

  * Proprietary DRM'd eBooks, such as those sold by Mobipocket, eReader, etc.  Books.app is released under the GNU GPL, and as such its source code must be open.  If the commercial eBook publishers want to pay me a lot of money to code a different, closed-source reader from scratch, I'd be happy to do so.  But Books.app will always be free and open-source.  (But never under estimate the power of reverse engineering...)

  * Downloading eBooks directly from the 'net, as opposed to the iTunes-esque download-to-computer-and-sync.  There are several reasons for this.  Most importantly, you can just read your books in Safari if you're connected to the Internet.  Secondly, don't forget that none of these iPhone hacks are supported by Apple, and the moment you update your iPhone software, all your books will vanish.  Therefore, it's _incredibly_ important to keep a local copy of all your books, so you can re-load them if needed!
