# Worse than beta... #

For any brave souls out there, automatic builds of Books are now available.  These are intended mostly for developers.  They're not tested before release, and they could easily turn your phone into a [smoking hulk of metal](http://www.willitblend.com/videos.aspx?type=unsafe&video=iphone).  These builds are automatically generated every time code is checked in.  If you don't know what a DFU restore is, please don't use these builds!
